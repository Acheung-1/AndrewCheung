			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Hi! I am currently pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Stony Brook with an interest in computational biology. I did my undergraduate studies in biological engineering at Cornell University. Upon graduation, I worked at Rockefeller University for 3 years as a research assistant where I engineered vaccine candidates for the Powassan virus and tested their safety and efficacy in a mouse model. After taking advanced courses in mathematics and computer science during my PhD, I became more interested in learning about efficient algorithms and web design. I have a knack for wanting to learn new things and am currently looking for opportunities in software engineering or data science.

				<h2>Research</h2><br>
				<p>
					During my time at Rockefeller University, I was exposed to many interesting projects and was lucky to work with many great scientists. One project I am most proud of being a part of is my first-author paper on characterizing a potential vaccine candidate for Powassan virus. Administered in a two-dose regimen in mice, our vaccine candidate (CIGM) protected ~70% of the experimental group from death. A control group given a vaccine to a related virus (YFV-17D) all showed signs of infection with an 11% survival rate. If you are interested in reading the paper, I have linked it below.

					<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11030612" target="_blank"> Powassan Virus Vaccine </a>
				</li>
				<p>
					This second paper describes a study on IRF1 deficiency in two unrelated children, who have a long history with mycobacteria diseases and no history of severe viral illness. Here, we show that human IRF1 is essential for IFN-γ-dependent macrophagic immunity to mycobacteria, but redundant for IFN-α/β-dependent antiviral immunity.

				<h2>Moments</h2><br>
				<p>
					Moments is a social network website, built with JavaScript with React.js on the front-end and an Express.js framework on the back-end. MongoDB Atlas is used to store the collection of posts and users. Users create an account by entering an email, username, and password. On the home page, users can view and like posts made by others. Users can also write their own posts that includes a title, image, and caption. Every profile is customizable with a profile picture and bio section and can be viewed by others.

				<h2>Retro-Doodle Jump</h2><br>
				<p>
					This is a game I created utilizing the Tkinter and Time libraries available in Python. Here, a player plays as a character in an infinite level climber game amid enemies and power ups, with each stage becoming increasingly longer in size.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is how to play:
				</p>
				<li>
					Move left and right using the arrow keys
				</li>
				<li>
					Use space to jump
				</li>
				<li>
					Green power ups gives increased jump size when you land on top of it
				</li>
				<li>
					Only touch the red Enemy platforms from the top, otherwise you lose!
				</li>
				<li>
					Reach the top black platform to win the stage
				</li>

			<h2>String Matching using FM-Index</h2><br>
			<p>
				The string-matching problem is an important class of string algorithms that is frequently used in bioinformatics to map sequencing reads to genes or protein sequences. This project incorporates many useful data structures, namely, the suffix array, Burrow-Wheeler transform (BWT), and the FM-index. Given a long text of length n and a short pattern of length m, the suffix array is created in O(nlogn) time by sorting suffixes according to the first 2<sup>i</sup> characters (not the most optimal algorithm but is sufficient). The FM-index searches for a pattern match in reverse order in O(m) time, utilizing the BWT to obtain the rank of each character and find its position in the suffix array. The KMP algorithm is used as a control and can find all matches of short patterns of length m in a long text of length n in O(n) time. This is used to test the FM index's accuracy and speed.

			<h2>Genome Recoding</h2><br>
			<p>
				My first real exposure to algorithmic design applied to biological research was during my time at Rockefeller University. We wanted to test if vaccine candidates could be made by increasing its susceptibility to the immune response by optimizing spacing of certain elements in the virus genome. The genetic code has a unique property where the number of distinct codon triplets (64) outnumber the number of unique amino acids (22), allowing for repetitive mapping of many codons to the same amino acid. Therefore, altering the genetic nucleotide sequence without changing the protein sequence is possible. The literature suggests that viruses can be weakened by optimizing the distance between nucleotide pairs of CpGs (Cs followed by Gs), with the optimal distance being 13-39 nucleotides apart.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01223-8" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"><sup>1</a> The host immune response, specifically the zinc-finger antiviral (ZAP) protein, will bind to these CpG islands in the RNA and degrade them.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Viral genomes are much smaller than the human genome (The Powassan virus I worked with is ~11 kb long). I wrote an algorithm that takes any valid genetic sequence and recodes the sequence to fit the criteria stated above. These recoded sequences can and have been experimentally tested in the lab as potential vaccine candidates.
